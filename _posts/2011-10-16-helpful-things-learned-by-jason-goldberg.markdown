Here's some of the things learned by Jason Goldberg running Fab.com I totally
agree with:

1. **Do one thing.**

  Find one thing you can do really well and focus entirely on that one thing.

1. **Say no!**

  Don’t do any thing else except for your one thing. Say no to meetings, ideas, proposal, b.s., outside of your core one thing.
  
1. **Service matters more than sales.**

  Sales go up and down. Service lasts forever.
    
1. **Make mistakes.**

  Take risks. Move fast. Learn faster.
    
1. **Celebrate your challenges.**

  Force the team to focus on why you suck, even while you’re growing.
    
1. **Be transparent.**

  The more people know, the better.
    
1. **Measure Everything.**
    
1. **Fill your gaps.**

  Bring in new talent to spur further growth.
    
1. **Say please & thank you.**

  People do things because they want to, not because they have to.
    
1. **Have fun.**

  Life’s too short to do it any other way.
